# 📊 Data Analysis with Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using the famous **Iris dataset**.  
The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers (*sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width*) for three species:  
- Iris-setosa  
- Iris-versicolor  
- Iris-virginica  

The analysis includes:
- Loading and exploring the dataset with **Pandas**
- Performing basic descriptive statistics
- Grouping and aggregating data by species
- Visualizing trends and distributions using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

---

## 📂 Files in this Project
- **iris.csv** → dataset in CSV format  
- **dataset.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook with full code and visualizations  
- **README.md** → project documentation  

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook dataset.ipynb
   ```
2. Ensure **iris.csv** is in the same directory as the notebook.  
3. Run all cells to load the dataset, perform analysis, and generate plots.

## 📈 Visualizations
The notebook generates:
- **Line Chart** → Sepal length trend across samples  
- **Bar Chart** → Average petal length per species  
- **Histogram** → Distribution of sepal width  
- **Scatter Plot** → Sepal length vs petal length (colored by species)  

---

## 📝 Findings
- Different iris species have distinct ranges for petal and sepal measurements.  
- *Iris-setosa* is the most easily distinguishable species due to smaller petal lengths.  
- Petal length is a strong feature for separating species.
